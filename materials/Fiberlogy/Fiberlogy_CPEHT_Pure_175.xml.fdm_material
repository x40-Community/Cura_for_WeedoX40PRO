    <description> CPE HT is a modern copolyester that stands out for its high mechanical and temperature resistance. As member of the polymers family, which includes PET-G and PCTG, it surpasses them in terms of resistance to high temperatures, even up to 110Â°C. Like other related materials, this filament has a high resistance to chemicals and lipids. It is odourless and BPA, BPS and styrene free and can be used to create food contact parts *. CPE HT will find numerous applications that require resistance to degrading conditions, such as in a dishwasher or in the process of chemical sterilization or UV radiation. Fiberlogy CPE HT is an attractive alternative to polycarbonate filaments. Having similar strength parameters as PC, it does not share with it the characteristics that make it difficult to use.</description>
