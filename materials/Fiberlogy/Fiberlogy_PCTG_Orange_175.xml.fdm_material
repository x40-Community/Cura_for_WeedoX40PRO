    <description>PCTG belongs to the same family of polyesters as the increasingly popular PET-G. Compared to its more popular counterpart, PCTG offers increased impact strength, temperature resistance and clarity, making it an excellent alternative to PET-G. This filament does not require a heated chamber, which makes it ideal for use with home printers. It ensures high dimensional stability, while low shrinkage prevents the model from cracking. This makes it an easy-to-print material, even for people without a lot of experience in 3D printing. Manufacturer recommendation: Nozzle 250-270°C, Heated bed 90-110°C, Cooling 25-50%</description>
