    <description>Adura™ is a high-performance Nylon filament made from co-polyamide with high printability, low shrinkage and extreme toughness. This material is excellent for high-strength, functional 3D-printed parts. It has superior strength and physical attributes when compared to consumer-grade materials, which makes it the preferred choice for many industrial applications. Adura™'s very low shrinkage allows for printing with very tight tolerances and accuracy. The excellent layer bonding, medium flexibility and good chemical and heat resistance makes it a very useful material for demanding applications.</description>
